# 28th July 2016 - Laravel Helsinki Opening
## Meetup's presentation

The presentation we saw, was built on top of a HTML presentation framework called reveal.js.  
https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/  

If you have PHP installed, and run `php -S localhost:8888` in the 28thJuly folder, you'll be able to access the slideshow from your browser at localhost:8888 address.
